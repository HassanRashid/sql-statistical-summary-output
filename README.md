# sql-statistical-summary-output
I used SQL to create a statistical summary output using a publicly-available data set for Amazon. The SQL code uses multiple joins, CTEs, and window functions to create a basic statistical summary output for the data from 2020-2022. I incorporate SQL industry standards and best practices in the code, as well as block and in-line comments to explain each step.
